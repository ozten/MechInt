## [2026-01-07 21:21:38] Completed MechInt-mhp
- Added restricted-loss FFT filtering helpers and dataset loss evaluation
- Added restricted-loss verification logic with synthetic tests
- Added token-weight forward path for filtered embeddings and ignored git scratch dir
- Suggestions: integrate restricted/excluded loss into training metrics when ready

## [2026-01-07 21:40:20] Completed MechInt-7ak
- Added excluded-loss computation (top-k frequencies removed) and saved excluded loss history
- Added excluded-loss spike verification and synthetic tests
- Logged excluded loss for initial/grokking/final checkpoints when available
- Suggestions: tune excluded-loss spike thresholds once real training metrics are available

## [2026-01-07 21:47:45] Completed MechInt-fej
- Added Fourier-plane projection and clock-geometry verification for token embeddings
- Added unit tests for clean-circle pass and wrong-frequency failure cases
- Suggestions: wire embedding clock verification into any future checkpoint analysis pipeline

## [2026-01-07 22:10:05] Completed MechInt-4uj
- Matched transformer defaults to the 1-layer spec and removed LayerNorm usage
- Added causal-mask wiring plus unit tests for config, embeddings, biases, activation, and masking
- Suggestions: update training/spec docs if any remaining references assume 2 layers

## [2026-01-07 22:16:47] Completed MechInt-abt
- Added MLP post-ReLU activation capture and rectified-sine verification via FFT/correlation metrics
- Added synthetic verification tests for rectified sine pass and noise failure cases
- Suggestions: wire MLP activation verification into training analysis runs post-grok

## [2026-01-07 22:19:58] Completed MechInt-e78
- Added grokking-spec validation for training hyperparameters and wired it into startup
- Expanded training config tests to flag deviations from required optimizer and schedule values
- Suggestions: extend validation to any CLI/config overrides if added later

## [2026-01-07 22:25:27] Completed MechInt-6z5
- Added accuracy jump validation around the grokking transition using validation accuracy windows
- Updated grokking verification config with an accuracy window and expanded unit tests
- Suggestions: tune accuracy window/tolerance if real runs show gradual pre-transition creep
