- Added FFT dominant frequency verification for embedding analysis
- Implemented verify_fft_dominant_frequencies_from_embeddings() with 3 key metrics:
  1. Modulus frequency fraction (checks if p=113 appears significantly)
  2. Normalized spectrum entropy (detects white noise vs structured peaks)
  3. Peak-to-median ratio (ensures strong dominant frequencies)
- Added FFTDominantFrequencyConfig and FFTDominantFrequencyReport structs

## [2026-01-08 00:05:00] Completed MechInt-ybn
- Determined Section 5.5 (6D manifold visualization) is OUT OF SCOPE for this repository
- Section 5.5 describes Claude 3.5 Haiku internal representations for character/line counting
- This repo focuses on modular arithmetic grokking (Power et al. 2022)
- Requires proprietary model access and different task domain (NLP vs arithmetic)
- All other spec visualizations (5.1-5.4) are implemented and in scope
- Decision documented in docs/section_5.5_scope_decision.md for future reference
- Suggestions: 6D manifold analysis would require separate repo with Claude API/model access

## [2026-01-08 00:15:00] Completed MechInt-6cn
- Verified burn 0.20.0-pre.6 is the latest available version
- Updated all compatible dependencies (35 packages) via cargo update
- Confirmed all 54 library tests pass after updates
- Code already uses Burn 0.20 API correctly (TrainStep/ValidStep, ClassificationOutput, Module traits)
- No API migration needed - implementation is current and correct
- Suggestions: next task is MechInt-jzl (transformer alignment), but it may already be complete

## [2026-01-08 00:30:00] Completed MechInt-jzl
- Verified transformer model is fully aligned with Burn 0.20 Module/nn API

  - Module derive macro on Transformer, TransformerLayer, and MLP structs
  - Proper nn imports: Embedding, Linear, MultiHeadAttention, Relu from burn::nn
  - Config pattern with .init() method for model creation
  - TrainStep/ValidStep traits implemented correctly in training.rs
  - ClassificationOutput used for forward_classification
- All 54 library tests pass, no deprecated API warnings from clippy
- Library and binaries compile successfully with Burn 0.20.0-pre.6

- Added RestrictedLossDropConfig and verify_restricted_loss_drop function in verify.rs
- Metrics computed at key checkpoints: epoch 100 (~step 1k), epoch 500 (~step 5k), grokking, and final
- Both restricted and excluded loss saved to JSON files in artifacts/
- Added verification logic: restricted loss should drop BEFORE validation accuracy improves
- Added verification logic: excluded loss should spike as model switches to Fourier algorithm
- Added 2 comprehensive unit tests for restricted loss drop verification
- All 56 library tests pass (added 2 new tests)
- Suggestions: next tasks are visualization pipeline (MechInt-c0w) and automatic grokking detection (MechInt-391)
