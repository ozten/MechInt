## [2026-01-07 22:25:27] Completed MechInt-6z5
- Added accuracy jump validation around the grokking transition using validation accuracy windows
- Updated grokking verification config with an accuracy window and expanded unit tests

## [2026-01-07 22:47:30] Completed MechInt-pnn
- Added diagonal ridge verification tests for constructive interference surfaces
- Implemented 5 comprehensive test cases covering diagonal, anti-diagonal, axis-aligned, flat, and noise patterns
- Tests confirm metric correctly detects diagonal periodicity stronger than axis-aligned periodicity
- Suggestions: apply this verification to post-grokking MLP neuron activations to validate interference hypothesis

## [2026-01-07 23:05:00] Completed MechInt-4qy
- Added snake curve shape verification to validate grokking phenomenon on log-scale plots
- Implemented verify_snake_curve_shape() with checks for early train convergence, val plateau, delayed val jump
- Added 5 comprehensive test cases covering valid grokking curves and common failure modes
- Verified log-scale plotting functions (plot_loss_history_dual_logscale, plot_accuracy_history_logscale, plot_grokking_combined_logscale) use .log_scale() API correctly
- All 44 library tests pass including new snake curve verification tests
- Suggestions: apply snake curve verification to actual training runs to confirm characteristic grokking shape

## [2026-01-07 23:30:00] Completed MechInt-coo
- Implemented weight norm decay verification for grokking phenomenon
- Added compute_model_weight_norm() to compute L2 norm of token embeddings
- Added verify_weight_norm_decay() with monotonic decrease and relative threshold checks
- Added 5 comprehensive unit tests covering pass/fail scenarios and edge cases
- All 49 library tests pass
- Suggestions: wire weight norm tracking into training loop to capture norms at each checkpoint

## [2026-01-07 23:45:00] Completed MechInt-b1p
- Added FFT dominant frequency verification for embedding analysis
- Implemented verify_fft_dominant_frequencies_from_embeddings() with 3 key metrics:
  1. Modulus frequency fraction (checks if p=113 appears significantly)
  2. Normalized spectrum entropy (detects white noise vs structured peaks)
  3. Peak-to-median ratio (ensures strong dominant frequencies)
- Added FFTDominantFrequencyConfig and FFTDominantFrequencyReport structs
- Added 5 comprehensive unit tests covering pass/fail scenarios
- All 54 library tests pass
- Suggestions: wire this verification into post-grokking checkpoint analysis to validate Fourier structure hypothesis

## [2026-01-08 00:05:00] Completed MechInt-ybn
- Determined Section 5.5 (6D manifold visualization) is OUT OF SCOPE for this repository
- Section 5.5 describes Claude 3.5 Haiku internal representations for character/line counting
- This repo focuses on modular arithmetic grokking (Power et al. 2022)
- Requires proprietary model access and different task domain (NLP vs arithmetic)
- All other spec visualizations (5.1-5.4) are implemented and in scope
- Decision documented in docs/section_5.5_scope_decision.md for future reference
- Suggestions: 6D manifold analysis would require separate repo with Claude API/model access
