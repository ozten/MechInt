{"id":"MechInt-l1a","title":"VERIFICATION: Core implementation is 100% specification-compliant","description":"Comprehensive verification against NOTES.md specification completed on 2026-01-07.\n\nVERDICT: ✅ SPECIFICATION COMPLIANT\n\nCore Implementation - 100% Match:\n✅ Dataset: modulus=113, train_fraction=0.4 (30-50% range), full 12,769 sample space\n✅ Model: 1-layer, d_model=128, n_heads=4, d_ff=512, ReLU, no LayerNorm, learned pos emb\n✅ Optimizer: AdamW with β=(0.9,0.98), lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1.0 (CRITICAL)\n✅ Training: batch_size=512, seed=42\n✅ Causal masking, bias terms enabled, decoder-only architecture\n\nCRITICAL CORRECTION - Steps vs Epochs:\n- Steps per epoch: ~10 (5,108 examples ÷ 512 batch)\n- NOTES.md refers to 'step 7,000' NOT epoch 7,000!\n- Expected grokking: **step ~7,000 = epoch ~700**\n- Default 20k epochs = 200k steps (WAY too long!)\n- Recommended: **2,000-3,000 epochs** = 20k-30k steps\n\nExpected Behavior (CORRECTED TIMELINE):\n- Phase 1 (step 0-1k, epoch 0-100): Train acc→100%, val acc→1% (memorization)\n- Phase 2 (step 1k-7k, epoch 100-700): Plateau - metrics frozen, internal shift  \n- Phase 3 (step ~7k, epoch ~700): GROK - val acc: 1%→90%+ in ~500 steps\n\nWhy This Should Grok:\n1. Data starvation (40%) forces algorithm search vs memorization\n2. High weight decay (1.0) drives low-norm solution preference  \n3. Single layer enables clean circuit analysis\n4. ReLU allows mathematical derivation\n5. No LayerNorm preserves additive decomposition\n6. Sufficient patience (recommended 2-3k epochs gives 20-30k steps, grok expected at 7k)\n\nOutstanding Work (see other verify-2 issues):\n- P0: Integrate advanced metrics (Restricted/Excluded Loss, weight norms) - step-based tracking\n- P0: Enable visualization pipeline (snake curve, embeddings, neurons) - pre/post grok snapshots\n- P0: Add automatic grokking detection at step ~7k (epoch ~700)\n- P1: 3D surface plots, checkpoint management at key steps\n- P2: Hyperparameter sweeps, code cleanup\n- UPDATE: Reduce default epochs from 20k to 2-3k\n\nThis issue tracks the VERIFICATION RESULT. Close this after confirming successful grok run at expected step count.\n\nLocation: All modules verified (data.rs, model.rs, training_config.rs, main.rs)\nReference: NOTES.md lines 94, 137 ('step 7,000')","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T23:43:29.925353Z","created_by":"admin","updated_at":"2026-01-07T23:52:49.784866Z","labels":["verify-2"]}
